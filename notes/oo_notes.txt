* class
  * classes are created with the class keyword
  * and an upper case Name for the class
  * a class instances is created with the new method
  * a class is a blue print of the states
  * and behaviors of the instances of the class
* initialize is a constructor method
  * it is called automatically when an instance is created
  * you can call the initialize method of a parent with super
  * the constructor can initialize instance variables
  * instance variables begin with @var_name
  * instance variables are only accessible via methods
  * the new keyword will create object and call constructor
  * allocate keyword creates object without calling constructor
  * default values can be passed and are used if the value is not specified
* methods
  * methods are functions in the body of a class
  * methods get called with dot notation: object.method
  * or with send:  object.send :method
  *
* access modifiers
  * all data is private and cannot be accessed outside the instance
  * methods are public, protected or private
  * public can be accessed from within the class and outside the class
  * private methods are perhaps subject to change
  * public methods are part of the class interface and should not be changed
  * protected methods are like private methods, but can be called with self
* inheritance
  * inheritances allows you to use a previously defined class in a new class
  * parent class is called the base
  * child class is called the derived class
  * the < operator creates a relationship between class DerivedClass < BaseClass
  * super method calls the intialize constructor method of the parent class
  * private and protected data and methods are inherited
  * inheritance does not affect access
  * super
    * calls a method of the same name in the base class
    * typically used to call the constructor initialize method
    * but can be used to call any method by the same name
    * automatically passes all argements
    * or can can be called with empty () to call no argments ()
* attribute accessors
  * variables are private and so can only be accessed by methods
  * methods
    * attr_reader creates a getter method for an instance variable
    * attr_writer creates a setter method for an instance variable
    * attr_accessor creates both getter and setter methods
    * called by passing a symbol of the variable to the method
    * as in: attr_accessor :name, :age
* class constants
  * constants can be declared for a class
  * like all constants, should be declared with all caps: CONSTANT
  * class constants are accessed with :: from the class
  * can be accessed from instance method
* @@class_variable is declared in the class and accessible from instances methods
* the to_s method
  * all class objects have a to_s method
  * it is called when an object is passed to the puts method
  * a program can define its own to_s method to override the standard to_s
* operator overloading
  * operators are simply methods defined for the class
  * they can be overridden as a class method to redefine them
* class methods
  * classes can have their own methods
  * a class method is called on the class, not on the instance
  * a class method cannot be called on the instance of a class
  * similarly, class methods do not have access to instance variables
  * class methods are defined use def self.method_name
  * class methods get called on the class name
* instance methods
  * are called on an object using the dot operator
  * three methods for creation
    * using the def keyword
    * using the attribute accessor: attr_reader, attr_writer, attr_accessor
    * created after object instanciation:
      def object.method
        # code
      end
